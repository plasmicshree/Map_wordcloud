Mechanochemistry deals with the behavior of molecule under applied stress. Constrained Geometries Simulate External Forces method is used in order to study the behavior of Silicon Carbide Nanoribbon (SiCNR) to find their behavior under external stress. This approach is based on the scan of potential energy due to change in nanoribbon geometry. Thus, applied stress is the negative gradient of change in energy. A hybrid density functional B3LYP as implemented in Gaussian09 suites of program is used for energy scan of the nanoribbon under study. Method comprise constrained geometry optimization of the stretched nanoribbon along with their energy scan. The change in successive energies along with their change in length helps in determining the externally applied force. Finally this work calculates their Young modulus and force-extension curves. The study also includes some fundamental electronic properties that undergoes in nanosystem with the application of external force.",STUDY THE MECHANOCHEMISTRY OF SILICON CARBIDE NANORIBBON (SiCNRs) BY USING FIRST PRINCIPLE,

The aim of this experiment was to study how quarks, which are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, are changed when they are bound up inside a nucleus such as Carbon compared to free protons and neutrons that are not held inside nuclei. In the experiment the electrons that scatter off from the target nucleus are detected with a set of particle detectors attached to magnets that allow us to select electrons that are scattered at a fixed angle while carrying a fixed fraction of the electrons beam's energy. Knowing the energy and angle of the scattered electrons we can reconstruct the distribution of energy of the quarks inside the nucleus (called its structure function). We can then compare the structure functions of Be, C and B to those from Deuterium (an isotope of Hydrogen which we consider to be an almost free proton and neutron) to figure out how the quark distributions change when they are held together inside nuclei by the strong nuclear force. One of the goals of this experiment is to verify if the changes to the quark distributions are caused by the protons and neutrons that are closest to each other rather than all of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus.",EMC ratios in Lighter Nuclei,

Hill sphere approximates the farthest gravitational influence a planet can have on its moons. If an object is gravitationally perturbed and pushed outside of this sphere, it will escape the orbit. Roche limit is the minimum distance from a center of a planet that a satellite can maintain stable orbits. Below this limit, the orbit decays and the satellite spirals into the host planet. In this work, we have determined orbital parameters that yield stable orbits for two hypothetical exomoons around a Jupiter-type exoplanet called Laliguras (HD-100777b) around the host star, Sagarmatha (HD-100777). We considered the mass of the exomoons to be equal to mass of Earth and mass of Moon.  For each set of the exomoon’s parameters, we plotted the Mean Exponential Growth for Nearby Orbits (MEGNO) maps to determine the range of exomoon’s periodic, aperiodic and quasi-periodic regions. Then, by selecting few points in these phase space maps, a direct orbital simulation is performed (for up to 50 Myr) to generate time series plots of the exomoons’ semimajor axis, eccentricity and other Keplerian elements. These time series plots are further analyzed to study the dynamics of the exomoons in 2-D and 3-D planes.","Orbital dynamics of hypothetical exomoons around a Jupiter-type exoplanet, Laligurans.",

It is assumed that ion-ion plasma is collisionless and both the positive and negative ion species have same mass, temperature, and degree of ionization. Simulation results show that the formation of sheath and presheath regions and fluctuation of plasma parameters in that region are affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature. It is found that the magnitude of electrostatic electric field at the vicinity of biasing electrodes is affected by the biasing voltage and ion temperature as well. This strong electric field close to the electrodes further prevents the flow of charged particles towards the electrodes. The presence of non-zero electric field at the quasineutral region suggests a presheath region similar to the electron-ion plasma. In the quasineutral region, the density of ions increases with the increase of biasing voltage and decreases with the increase in ion temperature of isothermal ions, respectively. Furthermore, the phase space diagrams for the ions are obtained which indicates the different regions of the plasma.

The measured absorbed dose rate in air was found in the range of 100.330 nGy/h to 170.506 nGy/h with average value 128.661 ± 14.637 nGy/h. The activity concentrations of the gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K were found 85.340 ± 21.423 Bq/kg, 74.326 ± 13.899 Bq/kg and 978.901 ± 161.189 Bq/kg respectively. The absorbed dose rate in air was compared with the terrestrial data. The statistical analysis showed positive and linear correlation between them.  The absorbed dose rate was also calculated from the activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides and was compared with the measured absorbed dose rate in air. The calculated absorbed dose rate from terrestrial data and measured absorbed dose rate in air was found nearly equal which showed that gamma radiation in air was from natural terrestrial radiation. The Annual Effective Dose (AED) was calculated from the average of measured absorbed dose rate and was compared with the study of other places in different parts of the world. The outdoor AED and Excess Lifetime Cancer Risk (ELCR) is calculated 0.157 mSv/y and 0.519 × 10-3 respectively, which is higher than the world average value. Higher air absorbed dose rate is measured due to high activity concentrations of gamma radionuclides 238U, 232Th and 40K in soils and rocks. The primordial radionuclides in the earth crusts and building materials produces gamma radiation and contribute dose which is hazardous for the human health.

UV-Vis spectrophotometry was used to estimate and evaluate the levels of iron in the studied vegetables, lentils and spices. Vegetarians are more vulnerable to the deficiency of iron as they consume non-heme iron which needs to be altered before it can be absorbed by the body. While, non-vegetarians are rarely a victim of iron deficiency as their diet consists of meat through which they consume proteins like hemoglobin and myoglobin directly in the unaltered form. Inevitably, there is a need to measure the amount of iron in the vegetarian food products to determine which food sources are rich in iron, so that they may be consumed during iron deficiency. Spectrophotometric technique of analysis was used to determine the iron content. It works on principle of the Beer-Lambert law. From the results thus obtained, the maximum contribution was shown by spices and condiments towards the dietary iron content whereas the minimum contribution was shown by vegetables and lentils.

The partial eclipse began at 08:14 LT (02:29 UT) and reached the full eclipse stage at 09:19 LT (03:34 UT) and then moved to the maximum eclipse position at 11:02 LT (05:17 UT).

It was 2 hours 47 mins and 54 secs long with the maximum visible eclipse time at ~ 10:01 LT (04:16 UT). Our study is based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements from a widely distributed Global Positioning System (GPS) network over different places of Nepal on the day of the eclipse, 5 days before and after the eclipse. We investigated the ionospheric behavior through the changes in Total Electron Content (TEC) during the partial eclipse over by using the data archived at the five different GPS stations of Nepal, viz. BRN2, TPLJ, RMTE, DNGD, and KKN4. The result reveals that there is significant depletion of TEC, in some cases greater than 20% compared to other normal days. Observing the values of TEC before, during, and after the event, our study showed an apparent variation during the time of the eclipse, which agrees with previous studies on ionospheric responses to the eclipse as well as theoretical assumptions.

It is assumed that the plasma is collisionless and electrons and ions have cut-off Maxwellian velocity distribution at the injecting side. It is found that the ion and electron concentrations decrease toward the collector surface. The ions are accelerated towards the negative biased surface whereas the electrons are repelled from it. However, those electrons having high thermal mobility can reach the collector surface. The sharp monotonic decrease of electrostatic potential near emitter and collector regions implies the formation of plasma sheath with collector sheath thickness larger than that of emitter. It is found that the electron and ion densities are dominant near the emitter and collector surfaces, respectively. In addition, the particle reflection coefficient decreases for both molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) surfaces with the increase in impact energy of ion, however, the reflection coefficient for W-surface is higher than that of Mo-surface about 34.43% in magnitude.

We have reported a set of 38 type II radio bursts during our observational period. All these radio bursts are found to be associated with flares and Coronal mass ejection (CME). The statistical analysis of the relationship between type II radio burst appearing in metric - decametric wavelength range is carried out. Further, we have estimated the CME height and initial acceleration of the CME using the kinematic equation. For density approximation, we have used the Newkirk model and for CME height approximation we have used the flare onset method. At the onset time of the flare, CME is assumed to be launched at least from the height of 1.25 Rʘ. With this approximation, we have reported that the estimated CME height at the time of type II initiation lies between 1.25 to 1.75 Rʘ. Our result indicates that the location of type II burst is in front of the leading edge of the CME and type II bursts are likely due to MHD shock driven by CMEs.

Historical climatological data from 1977 to 2020 were collected. Two well-established methods: ‘percentile analysis’ and ‘annual good/bad day percentage’ were used to investigate the trend of visibility.  Degradation of visibility in Surkhet during the 1980s was reflected from percentile analysis and minor recovery during the 2000s was observed. Visibility in Bhairahawa began a notable decline trend since the mid-80s.

In Surkhet, marked degradation of visibility started comparatively late since 2010 when simultaneous and sharp increase in bad day percentage (1-22.5% max) and decrease in good day (36.5-0%) percentage is observed. Strong seasonality in visibility was observed in both places. Bhairahawa displayed worse visibility conditions in winter (4.7 km), as expected.

Absorption lines and edges in UV and X-ray of AGN warm absorbers have been studied over long period of time. However, fundamental properties of warm absorbers like: What is the mechanism which drives the outflow? What is the gas density in the flow and the geometrical distribution of the outflow? Where does the outflow originate and what is its fate? Do ionized outflows play an important role on the host galaxy chemical history and evolution? are not determined precisely and are of great interest. 

Intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers show large global covering factors of the central continuum source. Blue shifted absorption lines in the spectra reveal the presence of massive outflows of ionized gas from their nuclei at speed of ∼ 1000 Km/s. Which potentially can reach to ISM and can have impact on the chemical evolution and star formation process in the host galaxy. This could even reach to intergalactic medium and enrich it with heavier elements called the feedback mechanism. The resulting mass outflow rate can be a substantial fraction of the accretion rate required to power the AGN. Thus, WA can be dynamically important and the knowledge of their state, location, geometry and dynamics would help in understanding the central engines of AGN. 

Progress towards understanding warm absorbers is limited by the assumption used so far in photoionization modeling: that the gas is in ionization and excitation equilibrium. This is almost certainly not correct in detail; the dynamical timescales in the flow are comparable to or less than the timescales characterizing the ionization and excitation, and the inverse processes in the gas responsible for the lines we observe. Which means the gas departs from equilibrium and so temporal dependency for ionization, heating & cooling and radiative transfer equation has to be included in the modeling of the absorber. The ongoing research is about inclusion of time dependence in the photoionization code XSTAR, which has already been developed. The goal is to do this in a way which is as general and computationally efficient as possible. Then we will use this code for self-consistent calculations of warm absorber dynamics.

In ferromagnets, an additional contribution to the Hall effect, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), appears proportional to the magnetization. It is also known that the AHE can arise in non-collinear and non-coplanar antiferromagnets due to scalar spin chirality. While the AHE itself bears the potential of application in electronic devices such as Hall sensors, quantization of the AHE can lead to exotic phenomena with potential for dissipationless electronics and quantum computing. Recently, a large AHE was observed in a collinear antiferromagnet CoNb3S6 [1]. The subsequent theories have indicated that the AHE in CoNb3S6 may be inherently related to the chirality associated with the crystal structure, a new mechanism for the anomalous Hall effect. Our recent experiment, however, suggests that the AHE is intrinsically related to the electronic band structure. In this talk I will present our recent results in which we have been able to tune the AHE by hole doping obtained in Co1-xFexNb3S6 samples. I will then discuss the importance of these results, which together with other recent related experimental findings [2] in CoNb3S6, suggest that quantization of the AHE can be achieved in CoNb3S6 by band tuning through optimal doping.

Abstract
The study of Structure, Electronic and Magnetic properties of 2D heterostructure (HS) materials Graphene-Molybdenum diSulphide (G-MoS2) with vacancy defects at C sites have been done by executing first-principles calculations, performed within the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) under the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA). The ven der Waals (vdW) interactions have been carried out into account (considered via Grimme’s model) by DFT-D2 approach. The (HS) G-MoS2 without and with C sites vacancy defects have been optimized using BFGS methods implemented in Quantum ESPRESSO package. These optimized geometries have been used to investigate the Electronic and Magnetic properties of pure and C sites vacancy defects (HS) G-MoS2 from the band structure calculations and DOS-PDOS analysis. By analyzing the calculations, we acquired that the pure (HS) G-MoS2 are metallic in nature and can be useful for low power consumption electronic devices, but C sites vacancy defects (HS) G-MoS2 materials have energy gap. From the band structures calculation, we found that Fermi energy level shifted towards the conduction band in vacancy defects geometries revels n-type Schottky defects. The analysis of the magnetic properties show that the non-magnetic pure (HS) G-MoS2 changes to magnetic materials by C sites vacancy defects. It is also found that total magnetism of  R-1C, L-1C, C-1C and 2C atoms vacancy defects have values -0.47µB/cell, -0.43µB/cell, -0.12µB/cell and +0.14µB/cell respectively and spins of 2s, 2p orbitals of C atoms have main contributions to the magnetism in all these configurations.

Charge symmetry is one such symmetry principle which says that the strong force which holds protons and neutrons inside nuclei is the same for protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of quarks and the charge symmetry principle restated in terms of these underlying quarks which states that the distributions of up quarks in the protons is the same as the distribution of the down quark in the neutrons and vice-versa. Since the mass of the proton and neutron, as well as the up and down quark, differ by about 1% it is expected that charge symmetry is violated at the 1% level.  However, experimental data collected so far can only verify charge symmetry to
 < ±10%. Yet, charge symmetry has been universally assumed as a bedrock principle in studying the distributions of quarks inside protons and neutrons.

Jefferson Lab experiment E12-09-002 was the first experiment to try to remedy the situation by precisely measuring the charge symmetry violation with an uncertainty of 1%.  In this experiment, electrons traveling almost at the speed of light collided with a target made of liquefied deuterium. The scattered electrons produced in the collision along with another type of charged particle known as pions (made up of a quark and an anti-quark) were detected simultaneously in a set of detectors attached to magnets that allow us to select electrons that are scattered at a fixed angle while carrying a fixed fraction of the electron beam's energy. The experiment alternately detected positive or negative pions which help us extract the distribution of up or down quarks in the deuterium nucleus. By taking this special ratio of the positive pions to the negative pions produced in the electron-deuterium collisions we can look for charge symmetry violation with higher precision than ever before. We will show preliminary results from the experiment and talk about the current progress in data analysis.

This talk will present the first experimental observation of a 4-fold quasicrystalline structure in a physical system. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) shows that fullerenes (C60) deposited on the surface of an icosahedral Al--Pd--Mn quasicrystal selectively adsorb atop specific atomic species, forming a Fibonacci square grid [2] (figure 1). The relative simplicity of such a model system provides an avenue to understanding the unusual properties of quasicrystals with higher order rotational symmetries. This site specific adsorption behaviour offers the potential to create tuneable structures in molecular overlayers, such as array of molecular magnets. The findings also demonstrate that molecules can be used as a chemical probe to identify atomic species on metallic alloy surfaces, a key step in understanding the surface structure of complex systems like quasicrystals. We will also discuss other unique structures of overlayer grown on quasicrystals [3, 4].

From retina to the brain, complex layers of interconnected sensory networks work together to select, organize and interpret seamlessly to produce a single experience, called perception in parallel with sight. Color, for example, is a perception that exists only inside the brain not in the world. Therefore, if the vision is lost, it is unlikely to restore its natural state, however, the major cause of blindness in humans is due to the death of photo-receptors cells only that convert light into a meaningful electrical signal. The non-photoreceptor cells and complex visual circuitry often remain largely intact. Therefore, various strategies are being developed to make other retinal cells photosensitive or interface artificially created electrical signals from a live image to the remaining visual circuitry.

Initial measurements of Cu-Cy’s hydroxyl radical generation ability show that it behaves as a Fenton-like reagent in the presence of H2O2 (100 μM) at pH 7.4, and that its Fenton-like activity is dramatically enhanced under acidic conditions (pH 6.5 and 5.5). Notably, Cu-Cy exhibits high stability and minimal copper release during the Fenton-like reaction, demonstrating its potency as a heterogeneous Fenton-like catalyst with a low cytotoxic effect. Through extensive in vitro studies, Cu-Cy NPs are found to generate a significantly higher level of ROS, thereby causing significantly more destruction to cancerous cells than to normal cells without the need for exogenous additives, such as H2O2. To the best of our knowledge, the average IC-50 value of Cu-Cy to cancer cells (11 μg/mL) is the lowest among reported heterogeneous Fenton-like nanocatalyst so far. Additionally, compared to cancer cells, Cu-Cy NPs display substantially higher IC-50 value toward normal cells (50 μg/mL), suggesting high selectivity.

It is very important to understand the relative contribution of first vs higher-order mechanisms in accurately describing the few-body dynamics. One higher-order process that is particularly important in ionization is known as post-collision interaction (PCI) where the projectile and the ejected electron interact with each other again after the primary interaction. It is well known that PCI maximizes when the ejected electron has the velocity equal to that of the projectile however, kinematically complete data were completely lacking in this region. We have performed kinematically complete experiments on ionization of H2 and He by 75 keV proton impact. The momentum analyzed scattered projectiles and recoil ions were measured in coincidence and the ejected electrons’ momenta were deduced from the conservation laws. Fully differential cross sections (FDCS) were measured for various fixed electron energies for each of the targets near the projectile-electron velocity matching region. Pronounced post-collisional effects between the projectile and the ejected electron were observed in the projectile scattering angle dependence, the electron emission angle dependence, and the electron energy dependence of the FDCS. The results were compared with two conceptually very similar calculations. Surprising differences were observed not only between experimental data and theory but also between similar theoretical models.  This shows that the FDCS are very sensitive to the details of the underlying few-body dynamics in this region.",Fully Differential Study of the Post-Collision Interaction in the Few-Body Dynamics of Simple Atomic Systems,

The conformational analysis of the title molecule was performed around eight flexible bonds by employing density functional theory (DFT) at B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) level and three stable conformers (conformer I, II and III) have been predicted. The vibrational spectra (IR and Raman) have been recorded in the solid phase showed a good agreement with theoretical spectra. The chemical reactivity prediction with the frontier molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap reveals that conformer I is the most stable with the highest energy gap among the three conformers, while conformer III is more chemically reactive due to least energy gap. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) flourished that the sulfinyl group is more electrophilic and N7H31 is more nucleophilic in nature. The local reactivity descriptor explored the idea about the reactive sites for further attacks from surrounding species. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis suggested that lone pair interaction from LP(1)N7→π*(N6-C16) is responsible for the stability of RBZ with the stabilization energy 61.96 kcal/mol. QTAIM study demonstrates that there exist two intramolecular hydrogen bonding in RBZ.

Chol content in these membranes do not exceeds 50 mol%. Only in membranes of fiber cell plasma membranes of the eye it content exceeds this value reaching concentration as high as 66 mol% (value close to the Chol solubility threshold). At these high concentration Chol induces formation of pure Chol bilayer domains (CBDs). Here we applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study mechanical properties of Chol/POPC membranes with Chol/POPC molar ratio changing from 0 to 3/1. Previously, AFM was used to study mechanical properties of membranes made of several phospholipids when Chol concentration did not exceeded 50 mol% (Chol/PL molar ratio < 1/1). To ensure the compositional homogeneity throughout the membrane assembly, we used the rapid solvent exchange method for the preparation of lipid unilamellar vesicles. These vesicles were used for preparation of supported lipid membranes. The surface roughness of the membrane decreases with increase of Chol content until it reaches 60% and roughness increases with a further increase of Chol content. We use force spectroscopy to assess the mechanical property of the membrane. For membranes with the Chol content of 50 mol% or lesser, only single puncture event was observed. However, for membranes with the Chol content 50 mol% or greater, two distinct puncture events were observed. We propose that one of the puncture events corresponds to the phospholipid cholesterol domain (PCD) and the other one to the CBD. We speculate that the puncture force in the CBD is lower than that in the PCB indicating the highly dynamic and fluidic property of CBD. This result agrees with our previous EPR findings.

The effects of different operating parameters, such as amount of Cu-Cy, H2O2 concentration, and dye concentration, were also investigated in detailed way to determine the optimal operating conditions. Additionally, radical scavengers on the degree of degradation of RhB were explored. Overall, it is believed that Cu-Cy/H2O2 system studied in this work could be used in advanced oxidation processes towards the degradation of organic pollutants.",Rapid and Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants by Catalytic Oxidation using Copper-Cysteamine Nanoparticles ,

The investigations of electronic and atomic reconstructions of pristine LaVO3 and CaVO3 have revealed that the former one is the Mott-insulator whereas the latter one is the correlated metal.
We have implemented the interfacial electrostatic bonds to investigate the possible growth of complex TMOs heterostructures of nearly infinite stable chemical combinations. With this vast possibility for tuning and combining properties, we can achieve various desirable change of many currently used electronic, optical and energy devices. 
The effect of different levels of filling controls on electronic structure and transport properties of heterostructure of supperlattices of LaVO3 and CaVO3 are studied by using the first-principle method with GGA approximation of WIEN2k frameworks. A patching software, BoltzTrap 1.5 is used for predicting the transport behaviours, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, transport coefficient, magnetic susceptibility etc. are observed for different levels of filling control.
Furthermore, the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) is implemented for realistic calculation of electronic structure of the materials. The spectral density of Matsubara frequency, which corresponds to density of states (DOS) for the system is investigated using the Maximum Entropy data analysis method for the resulting DMFT data obtained with ALPS-package and ABINIT package. The characteristics of spectral density of LaVO3 with U=5.0eV reveals that LaVO3 is the Mott-insulator. The result is consistent with the experimental observation of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

Here, we consider a rational approach for designing an artificial Li-metal/electrolyte interface. Facile, cost-effective, and one-step reaction mechanism of pretreating Li metal anode with an electrolyte containing SnF2 was employed for the first time. As a result, an artificial SEI composed of LiF, Sn, and Sn-Li alloy was formed. The higher ionic conductivity and Young’s modulus of an artificial layer facilitate fast Li-ion diffusion and suppress the Li dendrite growth, respectively.  An artificial SEI showed the synergistic effect of storing Li by forming reversible Sn-Li alloy and allowing Li plating underneath the SEI. Such protected Li symmetrical cells showed outstanding plating/stripping cycles with reduced overpotential compared to the bare Li. In addition, an artificial SEI protected Li anode coupled with high-loading (11.88 mg.cm-2) LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC111) showed remarkable results such as longer stable cycling, higher capacity at higher rates and higher rate capability compared to the bare Li anode.

A clear understanding of α-crystallin association with the eye lens membranes, particularly involving phospholipids (PLs), remains lacking. In this study, we investigate the size of α-crystallin and its association with one-palmitoy-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane by using dynamic light scattering (DLS). Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant PL in the eye lens of short-life-span animals. Small unilamellar POPC vesicles prepared by using a rapid solvent exchange method were mixed with α-crystallin and incubated at 37 °C for 16 hours for probing the association of α-crystallin with POPC membranes. One of the key findings of this study was that with the increase in temperature, the hydrodynamic diameter of α-crystallin decreased by ~3 nm; however, there was an abrupt increase in its size above 60 °C, indicating the aggregation of α-crystallin. Also, the hydrodynamic diameter of α-crystallin at various concentrations (0.75 – 10 mg/ml) was measured. The hydrodynamic diameter remains the same (~ 26 nm) up to 5 mg/ml concentration; however, it increases at higher concentrations reaching ~28.5 nm at 10 mg/ml concentration. Moreover, α-crystallin started to aggregate above 60 °C, and the size of aggregate increased with an increase in temperature from ~60 °C to ~90 °C. However, when α-crystallin was incubated with membranes, the size of α-crystallin aggregate decreased with an increase in membrane concentration. We speculate that with an increase in membrane concentration, more and more α -crystallin binds to the membranes, preventing aggregation. It is likely that at a higher temperature, surface hydrophobicity of α -crystallin increases that enhance the binding of alpha-crystallin with membranes via hydrophobic interactions. Our results give fundamental insights into the understanding of the α-crystallin-membrane association.

ABSTRACT

Our civilization has depended largely on cooperation among human beings. However, our science is yet to figure out ‘How did cooperative behavior evolve?’ This question from ‘What don’t we know’ series from the Science journal has been awaiting physical reasoning for a long time. We generalize the classical field theories for an ensemble of human beings and propose a new theory. The social field theory formalizes the energy of an individual in the social field. We underpin this new energy as a physical basis for cooperation among human and the evolution of human society.  

A fundamental understanding of why cooperation evolved may have a resounding effect on our understanding of social, political and economic rationale. Indeed, Darwin uncovered some general rationale of the cooperation. However, the science of evolution doesn’t provide physical reasoning, and also not adequate for the 21st century human consciousness.  Biologists are refining the Darwin’s ideas a bit by bit. Here, engineers aspire to uncover cooperative behavior in the terms of energy to be acknowledged by the learned societies. The human cooperation is not much different literally from cooperation that takes place between an electron and nucleons in a model of an atom.  It is our consciousness that makes cooperative behavior special among social beings.

The potential of this phenomenon has been explored in the field of cavity optomechanics, spanning from the preparation and interrogation of quantum states to cooling of mesoscopic system to their quantum ground state. However, recently, laser light has been used to cool bands of traveling-wave phonons on silicon chips. Here, we demonstrate laser cooling in an optical fiber for the first time by harnessing Brillouin scattering, an effect produced by the interaction of light and acoustic phonons. To realize this physics, this project utilizes a carbon disulfide liquid-core optical fiber (LCOF). These fibers have a number of important features that enable Brillouin cooling including single-mode operation for light, large Brillouin coupling and tight confinement of acoustic waves within the fiber core. Using heterodyne detection, we perform an experimental investigation of the spontaneous backward Brillouin scattering in an LCOF, revealing the thermal population and effective decay rates of phonons participating in the Stokes and anti-Stokes processes. Our measurements show that increasing pump power depletes the thermal population of anti-Stokes phonons while increasing the population of Stokes phonons, in addition to revealing pump power-induced changes to the Brillouin-active phonon decay rates. Optomechanical cooling is revealed through the peak height and linewidth for both Stokes and anti-Stokes processes. Our results demonstrate cooling of traveling-wave anti-Stokes phonons by 60K from room temperature.

To understand the working mechanics of drugs, the knowledge of the transport properties, estimation of free energy of solvation etc. of drugs in aqueous medium can play a significant role. We can also estimate the solubility of drugs from the free energy of solvation. In this work, we have performed the classical molecular dynamics simulations of a system containing binary mixture of amoxicillin and SPC/E water molecules at different temperature. The self diffusion coefficients of both the solute as well as solvent have been estimated from graph of mean squared displacement (MSD) as a function of time; and their binary diffusion coefficient using Darken's relation at temperature 293 K, 298 K, 303 K, 305 K, 310 K and 313 K. Also, the free energy of solvation of amoxicillin in water has been estimated at 310K from free energy perturbation method. The calculated values of self diffusion coefficient for solvent are in close agreement with previously reported values.",Molecular Dynamics Study of Amoxicillin in water,

The zero-gap (gapless) semiconductor in Heusler alloy have created a much interest, because of their extraordinary electronic property. These gapless materials have numerous practical applications in electronic devices, such as photo detector, photo generator, electromagnetic sensor and so on. Moreover, the gapless semiconductor with magnetism could have wide application in novel spintronic devices. The gapless property is observed in Co-Mn based quaternary Heusler alloy CoMnVAl employing first-principles calculations through density functional theory (DFT) based on Tight Binding Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital within Atomic Sphere Approximation (TB-LMTO-ASA) with local density approximation (LDA) and exchange correlation.
We here observed density of state(DOS) and band structure of optimized CoMnVAl. The structure of CoMnVAl is found to be FCC with lattice parameters 5.66 A 0 (10.68 a. u.), which fairly agree with experimental value 5.80 A 0 (10.95 a. u.) [1]. From the spin polarized band structure and DOS, CoMnVAl is found to have zero-gap energy bands of indirect type at Fermi level. Which is in clear agreement with the previously calculated theoretical and experimental results [2]. The highest energy gap between valance band (VB) at L point and conduction band (CB) at the same point implies that the highest energy is required when an electron hole pair is created by transferring the electron from VB to CB at the same point L. While, the lowest (zero) value of indirect gap between CB and VB respectively at X and G designate the smallest energy required for electron hole pair at these points. By the analysis of fat band and partial DOS, the major contribution to energy bands and DOS near Fermi
level is found from d orbital electron of cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn) and vanadium (V) and little from s and p orbital electron of aluminum (Al). The symmetric nature of DOS in majority and minority spin channel reveals that there is no magnetic moment either in parent CoMnVAl or in individual atomic cite. The absence of magnetic moment in 24 valance electron quaternary Heusler alloy CoMnVAl strongly support the Slater Pauling rule [3] . Finally, the complex type of bonding (i. e. mixture of covalent, metallic and some how ionic) is ascertained between atoms in CoMnVAl.

The cold electrons and negative ions are considered to obey the Maxwellian distribution whereas the hot electrons follow the truncated Maxwellian distribution. The kinetic Bohm sheath condition has been extended and derived for the case of more than one species of negative charged particles in which the concentration of hot electrons have crucial role to achieve the Bohm velocity. The thermal motion of hot electrons is so higher as compared to the cold electrons and negative ions that the variation of hot electrons concentration plays key role in the determination of plasma sheath parameters; particle densities, electrostatic potential, and flow of positive ions towards the wall.

Disentangling of the factors which control the spectral shift is complicated by the stabilization of a charge-transfer-like excitation of the dye in polar environments. Predicting the emission therefore requires modeling both the relaxation of the environment and the corresponding evolution of the excited state. Here, an approach is presented in which (i) the local environment is sampled by a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the dye and solvent, (ii) the electronically excited state of prodan upon light absorption is predicted by numerical quantum mechanics (QM), (iii) the iterative relaxation of the environment around the excited dye by MD coupled with the evolution of the excited state is performed, and (iv) the emission properties are predicted by QM. The QM steps are computed using the many-body Green’s function in the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation with the environment modeled as fixed point charges, sampled in the MD simulation steps. The comparison to ultrafast time-resolved transient absorption measurements demonstrates that the iterative molecular mechanics (MM)/QM approach agrees quantitatively with both the polarity-dependent shift in emission and the time scale over which the charge transfer state is stabilized. Together the simulations and experimental measurements suggest that the evolution into the charge transfer state is slower in amphiphilic solvents.",Predicting Spectral Properties of Polarity Sensitive Dyes with QM/MM Simulation,

",Author Name/s; Title of the Presentation and Abstract,No,Yes,Condensed Matter Physics and Material Science,"Transition metal carbides (MXenes) are an emerging family of highly conductive two-dimensional materials with additional functional properties introduced by surface terminations. Further modification of the surface terminations makes MXenes even more appealing for practical applications. Herein, we report a facile and environmentally benign synthesis of surface-engineered Ti3C2Tx MXene (r-Ti3C2Tx) via a simple treatment with L-ascorbic acid at room temperature with enhanced quality. r-Ti3C2Tx shows a six-fold increase in the electrical conductivity, from \ 471 \pm49 for regular Ti3C2Tx to  2819\pm306 S/m for the reduced version. Additionally, we show an enhanced oxidation stability of r-Ti3C2Tx as compared to regular Ti3C2Tx. An examination of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity reveals that the SERS enhancement factor of r-Ti3C2Tx is an order of magnitude higher than that of regular Ti3C2Tx. The improved SERS activity of r-Ti3C2Tx is attributed to the charge transfer interaction between the MXene surface and probe molecules, re-enforced by increased electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level of r-Ti3C2Tx. The findings of this study suggest that reduced MXene could be a superior choice over regular MXene, especially for the applications that employ high electronic conductivity, such as electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors, photodetectors, and SERS-based sensors.","Surface-engineered Ti3C2Tx MXene with Enhanced Conductivity, Oxidation Stability, and Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering Activity",

This research work focuses  to study the affecting factors like sunshine hour, ambient temperature and relative humidity for the estimation of total solar radiation (TSR) in Mid hill region Kathmandu (lat: 27.70oN, Long: 85.5oE and Alt. 1350m) for years (2010-2015). All those meteorological parameters vary not only seasons to seasons but also local weather conditions as well. Since there is no sufficient reliable measured data of solar radiation at many places of Nepal, empirical models are used to predict the solar radiation potential at various places of Nepal. To find the TSR potential, at Mid Hill location Kathmandu, the modified Angstrom model is used on the basis of sunshine hour, temperature and relative humidity. After using regression technique, the empirical coefficients are found and those coefficients are utilized to predict the TSR. For the validation of this research work statistical tools such as Mean Percentage Error (MPE), Mean Biased Error (MBE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of determination (R2) are analyzed, These values are  3.039, -0.06, 2.75 and 0.728, respectively for the new Model E based on sunshine hour, temperature difference and relative humidity among the five models. Here Model E is better than other models because all the errors are smaller and the value of coefficient of determination is higher compare to other models. Finally, it is concluded that the empirical constants are utilized for predicting TSR at similar geographical location of Nepal. In addition that the solar energy can be utilized to mitigate energy crisis at that location and it also helps to grow more crops using the energy at the modern agriculture farmland.

Our selection is a nebular structure at galactic longitude 337.410 degrees and latitude -20.840 degrees at a distance of 200.97pc, 0.5 × 0.5 degrees IRIS, and 0.4 × 0.4 degrees AKARI map of NGC7293 is downloaded from sky view virtual observatory and then processed in the software ALADIN v2.50. The minimum and maximum temperatures from AKARI all-sky map are found to be 19.90 K and 37.46 K respectively. Also, the average temperature via slope of linear plot in the flux is found to be 22.25 K. Similarly, the minimum and maximum temperatures from IRIS all-sky map are found to be 23.99 K and 24.82 K respectively and the average temperature via slope of linear plot in the flux is also found to be 31.38 K. The total mass of the structure is found to be 3.04×1028 kg and 6.46 ×1026 Kg in AKARI and IRIS images. The flux density variation along the major and minor diameters showed a Gaussian-like distribution, suggesting local thermodynamical equilibrium in the isolated structure. The Jeans mass of the dust in the NGC7293 nebular structure in AKARI image is found to 2.29×1033 kg, and in IRIS image is found to be 4.41×1033 kg which is much greater than the total mass, so we have concluded that the structure is not a star-forming region and is in local thermodynamic equilibrium.

as parent bulk MAX phase. In case of terminated derivatives, the terminated species are
distributed randomly on surface of pristine sheet with preferred location in the sites of va-
cant space between Ti atoms in pristine sheet. In contrast of electronic properties, We found that, all the studied MXene are metallic with large conductivity except Ti2CO2, It is ex-
pected to be semiconducting. Similarly for magnetic properties, without termination it show
magnetic nature but with termination magnetism is completely destroyed. Now, currently we
are studying vacancy defect in Ti2N and Ti2C separately.","COMAPARATIVE STUDY OF FUNCTIONALIZED MXENE(Ti2N, AND Ti2C)",
